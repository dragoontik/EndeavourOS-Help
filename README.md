# EndeavourOS-Help
 Tips and trick to help you do development in EndeavorOS (An Arch Based Linux Distro) \
**Note:** Most of these tips should work for other Arch based Distributions as well! üòâ

# Install EndeavorOS using offline mode
Installing EndeavourOS via offline mode helps minimize system compatibility. You can always change the desktop env later if you don't like KDE. (Who doesn't like KDE ü§∑?)

# System Upkeep! 

## Useful pacman (and yay commands)

### Update system

### Dealing with Package Cache!

### Checking the disk size of the cached packages

* sudo pacman -Sc
* yay -Sc
